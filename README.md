Sinatra MVC Project for Flatiron Online Full Stack Program


The project requires the creation of a MVC application using Sinatra - ActiveRecord with implementing CRUD and
RESTful conventions. 

I chose to create a Personal Travel Log application. It is basic in form but has potential to be expanded.

The user creates credentials which allows them to login to their travel itineraries. The user credentials are validated
for access. The user has the ability to create, edit, read and delete their own itinerary records. Input data is 
validated and error messages are displayed to alert user to problem.

Access the application through localhost. The index page invites the user to sign up or login to start the application.
The user is then directed to a personal page displaying a travel itinerary list. They are able to select records from 
the list to view/edit the record. If there are no itineraries displayed they have the option to create a new record or
logout.

My goal is to continue to work on this application by adding a travel expense section and add more styling with CSS.
